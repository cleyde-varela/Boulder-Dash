# Boulder-Dash

## ðŸ“Œ About this project
* It's a game developed using Java trying to replicate the Arcade game Boulder Dash (for more info visit https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Boulder_Dash).
* The main objective of the game is to move the character in order to collect all diamonds and head to the gate without touching an enemy and it ends when all levels are completed.
  
## ðŸ“Œ The reason behind it
I built this game as a final project for *one of my favorite subjects* "Object Oriented Programming (PO2 for short)".
I had a paper with some points that I had to implement in a specific way in order to get a positive grade.

## ðŸ“Œ Specifications
* The game is fully developed in Java using OOP.
* Abstract classes are used.
* The main character is a singleton.
* The main character is controlled using the arrow keys.
* The game levels are created by reading text files.
* There's a simple dialog box in the beginning that asks for the user's name and explains the rules.
* When the character collects a diamond it disappears and the points go up (point s = N D iamond s âˆ— 100 âˆ’ 5 âˆ— N M ov e me nt s).
* When the character touches an enemy the level reinitiates.
